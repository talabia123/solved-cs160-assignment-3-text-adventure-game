<strong> Systems vs. Applied CS options: </strong>

You need to navigate the EECS advising website and research the similarities and differences in the systems versus applied options, as well as answer the following questions:

<ul>

 <li>What are the similarities between the two degrees?</li>

 <li>What are the differences between the two degrees?</li>

 <li>Which degree do you see yourself more interested in?</li>

 <li>Even if you are more interested in the Systems degree, what would you be interested in with the applied? Which pre-approved plan would you pick or which plan would you create on your own, and why?</li>

<h1>Computation(Don’t worry, we will discuss this more in class and lab this week!)</h1>

<strong>(70 pts)</strong> We have been learning about problem-solving skills, algorithms, data representation, and operations on data.  Given the following problem, use George Polya’s problem-solving steps to solve the problem.

The local middle school would like some text adventure games to keep their students occupied during down time. The school is leaving it up to your skill and good judgement to develop a game. You need to have 5 different endings, but other than that requirement, you are free to do whatever else you want.

<ul>

 <li><strong>(10 pts) Understanding the Problem:</strong> You must state any assumptions about the problem and requirements to solve the problem. <strong>How do you understand the problem? What do you think are the requirements for this game? </strong></li>

 <li><strong>(20 pts) Devise a Plan:</strong> You must handwrite instructions/plan for solving the problem. Be VERY explicit!!! <strong>Write a flowchart or pseudocode to show your logic and thinking. </strong></li>

 <li><strong>(10 pts) Looking Back:</strong> You must test your instructions on paper showing how any piece of data would change with each instruction using pictures. <strong>What will happen with good data?  What will happen with bad data?</strong>  Provide your expected results.</li>

 <li><strong>(30 pts) Carry out the Plan:</strong> Implement your solution and see how explicit your instructions are.</li>

</ul>




<strong>An example of the run of the program looks like this (but it can be any variation with 5 different endings or paths): </strong>

Hello and welcome to the adventure! To go right enter 1, to go left enter 2: 1

You chose to go right. You have now entered Scandinavia and are being hunted by friendly oxen.

Enter 1 to befriend the oxen, enter 2 to run from the oxen: 1

You attempted to befriend the oxen. You think you can ride them. Enter 1 to attempt to ride the oxen, enter 2 to walk away: 1

Unfortunately, fate was not on your side, and you did not befriend the oxen. Enter 1 to walk right, enter 2 to walk left: 1

You chose to go right. You have now entered America and are fighting a strong warrior. Enter 1 to throw your arrow at the warrior, enter 2 to run home: 2

You chose to go home.  The adventure has ended.

<strong>Now, write the Python program for your text adventure game using variables, expressions, and if/else statements. </strong>

<strong> Extra Credit: </strong>

You need to have 4-5 different nested if/elif statements.  It doesn’t matter how you nest these statements, but you need to have some if statements that include other if statements. These need to be represented in your logic/problem solving steps, as well as your program.
